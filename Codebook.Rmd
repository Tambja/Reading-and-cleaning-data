## Descriptions of variables used in **summary_data.txt**

run_analysis.R prepares the run_data.zip to a clean format as required in the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" peer graded assignment. 

### 1. Assigning the data

1. features <- UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt
    + extracts "n, feature names"
    + 561 obs. of  2 variables
2. activities <- UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt"
    + extracts "act_code, activity"
    + 6 obs. of  2 variables
3. subject_test <- UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
    + extracts "subject_code"
    + 2947 obs. of  1 variable
4. x_test <- UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
    + extracts feature names of test data
    + 2947 obs. of  561 variables
5. y_test <- UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt
    + extracts activity codes of test data
    + 2947 obs. of  1 variable
6. subject_train <- UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
    + extracts "subject_code" from training data
    + 7352 obs. of  1 variable
7. x_train <- UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
    + extracts feature names of training data
    + 7352 obs. of  561 variables
8. y_train <- UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt
    + extracts activity codes of training data
    + 7352 obs. of  1 variable


### 2. Merge the training and test sets, then merge the two subject tables toether, then combine all.  

9. x_merged  <- merges features from train and test data sets using rbind 
    + 10299 obs. of  561 variables
10. y_merged <- merges activities from train and test data set using rbind
    + 10299 obs. of  1 variable
11. subject_merged <- merges subject_train and subject_test using rbind
    + 10299 obs. of  1 variable
12. all_merged <- merges subject_merged, x_merged, y_merged using rbind 
    + 10299 obs. of  563 variables


### 3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

13. final_data <- extracts columns from all_merged
    + selecting subject_code, act_code, and variables that contain mean and standard deviation of each measurement
    + 10299 obs. of  88 variables
                    
              
### 4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

14. final_data$act_code <- updated variable in final_data that represents the names of activities rather than a code  (from the activities variable)
    

### 5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 


**Final_data columns renamed:**
    + Column 1 renamed to SubjectCode
    + Column 2 renamed to Activity
    + All names with Acc changed to Acceleometer
    + All names with Gyro changed to Gyroscope
    + All names with BodyBody changed to Body
    + All names with Mag changed to Magnitude
    + All names with the character ^t changed to Time
    + All names with the character ^f changed to Frequency
    + All names with tBody changed to TimeBody
    + All names with -mean() changed to Mean 
    + All names with -std() changed to STD
    + All names with -freq() changed to Frequency
    + All names with angle changed to Angle
    + All names with gravity changed to Gravity


### 6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

15. summary_data <- summarises final_data with the means of the variables for each SubjectCode and Activity
    + grouped_df [180 rows Ã— 88 columns]
